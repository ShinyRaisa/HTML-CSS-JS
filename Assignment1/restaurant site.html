   <h2 id="vx">Chicken</h2> 
    <p>Midway upon the journey of our life
    I found myself within a forest dark,
    For the straightforward pathway had been lost.
    Ah me! how hard a thing it is to say
    What was this forest savage, rough, and stern,
    Which in the very thought renews the fear</p>
  </div>
  <div class="column2">
    <h2 id="vy">Beef</h2>
    <p>So bitter is it, death is little more;
    But of the good to treat, which there I found,
    Speak will I of the other things I saw there.
    I cannot well repeat how there I entered,
    So full was I of slumber at the moment
    In which I had abandoned the true way</p></div>
  <div class="column3">
    <h2 id="vz">Sushi</h2>
      <p>But after I had reached a mountain’s foot,
    At that point where the valley terminated,
    Which had with consternation pierced my heart,
    Upward I looked, and I beheld its shoulders 
    Vested already with that planet’s rays
    Which leadeth others right by every road.</p></div>
